I'm Zach, founder of [D-Star](https://d-star.ai). I split my time between doing AI engineering consulting and working on open-source projects, like [dsRAG](https://github.com/D-Star-AI/dsRAG).

I specialize in building next-generation RAG systems that push the boundaries of what's possible with retrieval-augmented generation. My work focuses on improving accuracy, efficiency, and explainability in AI systems.

With a background in both software engineering and AI research, I enjoy bridging the gap between cutting-edge academic research and practical, production-ready solutions.
